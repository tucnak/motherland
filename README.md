Motherland CSS
--------------

Motherland is a dead simple modern technology, which do reckon with the old school. We are damn
pissed off by css hipsters and all the new sorts of crap appearing online every single day. Material
design, huh? Bootstrap? Pure.css, whatever. We are men, not a bunch of creepy hippy. We want to
deliver user some information without web3.0-ish maroon interface.

From the developer's perspective, Motherland is designed to be super intuitive, so the whole markup
thing looks logical and clear for anyone looking at the source code of your project. You guys are
fighting at the front of user experience, where little mistakes do matter. Your task is to create
user interface that will feel smooth for the end user. Right now, go on and just ask yourself, would
you want your users to get distracted with some hippy shit? â€” We don't.
